           <h4> WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING?</h4> 
        <p>Cloud Computing describes a scenario whereby computing resource is delivered as a service over a network connection, usually the internet.</p>
        
        <p>Cloud computing relies on sharing a pool of physical and/or virtual resources, rather than deploying local or personal hardware and software. It is somewhat synonymous with the term ‘utility computing’, as users are able to tap into a supply of computing resource rather than manage the equipment needed to generate it themselves.</p>
